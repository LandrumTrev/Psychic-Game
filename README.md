# The Psychic Game
##### Guess the letter the computer is thinking of

JavaScript, CSS, HTML, GitHub. App takes keyboard input for letter guesses, counts letters guessed, tracks player wins and losses.

My first JavaScript web application (August 2018). Game takes keyboard input for letters guessed, and displays a count and a list of incorrect letters already guessed (duplicate guesses count as additional guesses). When a correct letter is guessed, Wins is incremented by one and a new letter to guess is loaded. If the user guesses nine letters without guessing the correct one, Losses is incremented by one and the game resets a new letter to guess.
